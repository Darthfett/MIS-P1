# Installation #

This project will use the [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) library for python, which provides a python interface to manipulate images.

1. Download and install the x86 (32-bit) version of [python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/).
2. Add the python installation directory (e.g. C:\Python27) to your $PATH environmental variable.
3. Download and install the latest version of [PIL for Python 2.7](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/).

The PIL library should now be installed, and you should be able to run the program main.py with `$ python main.py`.
